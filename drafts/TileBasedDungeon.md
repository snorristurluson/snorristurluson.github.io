It's been done a million times before, but want to try to make my own tile-based dungeon crawler in Unreal
Engine. If nothing else, it will be a good playground for all sorts of tests, including navigation, simple AI,
rendering effects, modeling, optimizations in Unreal, etc.

* Build 3d level from 2d ascii level description
  * Easy authoring for tests
  * Build a simple tileset in Blender - easy to make variants for more interesting visuals
    
* Auto-generate dungeons
  * [http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2014/12/21/rooms-and-mazes/](http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2014/12/21/rooms-and-mazes/)
  * Variants on the approach described above, such as adding rooms, then connecting them directly
    
* Add props, effects, decals, etc

* Build a simple editor, allowing the player to carve out a dungeon or customize an auto-generated one
