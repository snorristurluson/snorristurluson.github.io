## Property Bindings in Unreal UMG
UMG widgets offer property bindings for many properties, allowing you to bind properties of widgets
to functions or properties inside the blueprint. How to use this is well explained in
[UE4 documentation](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/InteractiveExperiences/UMG/UserGuide/PropertyBinding/index.html)
but the adding support for this in custom widgets is not really explained.

* add delegate
