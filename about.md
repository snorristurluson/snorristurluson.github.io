I am co-founder of [Arctic Theory](https://arctictheory.com) - a games studio specializing in 
massively multiplayer games.
Before that, I was a Senior Software Developer at [Genuity Science](https://genuitysci.com/), 
working on [GOR](https://github.com/gorpipe/gor) - a genomic 
database engine. Prior to that I was a software architect at [CCP Games](https://www.ccpgames.com/). 
Worked on the launcher, Wine support, graphics engine and other random stuff for 
[EVE Online](https://www.eveonline.com/), usually low level.

I've also worked at EA Games, mostly on Sims titles, and Midway Games West (formerly Atari Games),
as well as another game studio I co-founded (Lightspeed Games).

This blog details some interesting things I've run into at work, as well as new things I'm trying out 
in my spare time. At Arctic Theory I'm working in Unreal Engine 4, both in C++ and Blueprints. 
Before that I played around with Vulkan, and tried some new programming languages - Erlang/Elixir, Go, 
Swift whereas most of my work in the past is in C++ and Python.
